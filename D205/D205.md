## Practical Assessment(s) Overview & Files

This course has a single Practical Assessment. This project requires the student to access a virtual machine and use PostgreSQL and pgAdmin to import an external .csv file into an existing database as a new table, designing conceptual, logical, and physical models describing this. Once imported, the database must then be explored and queries generated of particular complexity to answer a research question developed by the student. 

My research question for this project was *"What's the average income for customers with tech support?* This task was solved with a simple query. [My report for this project can be viewed here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Az0yHXw-Yrd7pBP01ALLsfQ2gUHynaDt/view?usp=sharing)
